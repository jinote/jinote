### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Hojin Lee.

I am currently pursuing a Masters' degree in Information Systems/Data Analytics at Baruch College. Besides being a full-time student, I am also a teaching assistant for SQL and Python courses, having up to 70 students. 

Before joining the graduate program, I had worked as a research assistant for the technology team at Hyundai NGV in Korea for 1.5 years. During my time there, I focused on data/information collection, researching on new automobile technology and trends, and creating data visualization. From this experience, I had a chance to work with data analysts analyzing customer feedback data to understand customersâ€™ needs and consumer trends. Then I realized I was not only interested in this kind work but also had the skills and abilities to succeed. Therefore, I decided to change my career and obtain a masterâ€™s degree in data analytics in the US.
